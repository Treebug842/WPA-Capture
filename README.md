# WPA-Capture
I wanted to practice python and bash and this was an old favourite script from when I was developing autoScript. So I decided to remake it in bash and python again XD.

# Usage
Simply run the capture script first, scan and select your target. Then either wait for a device to reconnect or if your impatient, in another tab the deauth script and send de-authentication packets to a device until you've got a handshake. With the deauth script; the targets for devices are gathered from the initial scan. So when your scanning for networks even if your target network appears you should probably run it longer to pick up more devices XD. 


# Use Legally
Remember to use this responsibly, by responsibly I mean don't do anything illegal, I'm not held responsible for anything you do.
